_To:_  Pomona, Rona

_How:_ 
By foot, raft, foot, raft, 1 day trapping too, raft, foot, campervan hitch. 2 damp non-functioning moths brought home to dry out, 5 new 1/30 project moths placed on Pomona, and Rona, 10 total.

_Report:_ 
2023-06-27\n\nI was on Pomona and Rona around the 10th or 12th of June, after the bad May weather ended.\n\nFrom 10 moth recorders 2766 kiwi calls were detected. 258 duets, 316 solo female calls, 1934 solo male calls. Best of all only 175 false positives, 7%.\n\nI had to bring home the moths at F09 and G05 as they were giving an error code, having dried out they are ready to go out again soon.\n\n5 new moths were placed on Pomona, recording 1 minute in 30, 24/7.\n\n5 new moths were placed on Rona, also recording 1 minute in 30, 24/7.\n\nIn theory the batteries will last a year. I plan to refresh the sd cards in the summer to check it is all good.  The plan is to train a model to recognise more birds than just kiwi, they should provide a more accurate version of the 5 minute bird count, at least. Over a long period it should be a valuable and informative dataset.\n\nThe Hollyford Conservation Trust has agreed to let me place 5 new moths there, also  recording on the 1/30 schedule. Can’t wait to get down there. I have my eye on the McKenzie Lagoon. (Ideal habitat for Haast Kiwi, perhaps one day, if the right people can agree. For them to grow and survive long term we need to get them the best habitats with well organised and motivated predator control.)\n\nThe skraak.kiwi website has not been updated, it is proving difficult to update and maintain. I need to make a better plan, perhaps as simple as a pdf report published to the website, thinking still.\n\nThe weather was pretty poor during the recording period, with a lot of noise and feint or distant sounding audio. Birds from the dawn chorus were not a problem. No Kaka found, some Kea from time to time.\n\n## Audio\n- [Interesting female F09](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1687827936/Pomona/2023-06-27/F09-2023-06-10-20230525_041500-22-55_zeifbs.mp4)\n- [Female H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1687828051/Pomona/2023-06-27/H04-2023-06-10-20230428_224500-167-200_i4mmtt.mp4)\n- [Duet D03](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1687828326/Pomona/2023-06-27/D03-2023-06-10-20230421_201500-372-423_mqc6xh.mp4)\n- [Duet D09](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1687828420/Pomona/2023-06-27/D09-2023-06-10-20230501_181501-342-388_g80rwr.mp4)\n- [Duet H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1687828564/Pomona/2023-06-27/H04-2023-06-10-20230419_051500-675-715_oaty04.mp4)\n- [Duet M04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1687828670/Pomona/2023-06-27/M04-2023-06-10-20230418_203000-847-895_vfymc9.mp4)\n- [Duet N20](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1687828994/Pomona/2023-06-27/N20-2023-06-10-20230415_194500-302-340_zghpb4.mp4)\n- [Male F09](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1687829135/Pomona/2023-06-27/F09-2023-06-10-20230510_011500-720-753_wgicxw.mp4)\n- [Very happy with the way my best model copes with noise, G05](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1687829219/Pomona/2023-06-27/G05-2023-06-10-20230515_010000-127-150_syhnax.mp4)\n- [Noise central, N20](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1687829396/Pomona/2023-06-27/N20-2023-06-10-20230426_051500-195-218_xmfu7a.mp4)

2023-04-21\n\nI was on Pomona and Rona last weekend collecting sd cards and reconfiguring moths to record longer winter hours.\n\nThe new model worked a treat, There were around 3200 detections and only 13% false positives. This is because the moths were not recording anywhere near sunrise or sunset due to the longer nights.\n\nSince I now sort calls into Male/Female/Duet with a secondary model there is a lot less work for me to do, I was finished on Tuesday evening. \n\nThe analysis is now where I get to spend my time, which is great.\n\nLots of work has happened on the new [skraak.kiwi](https://skraak.kiwi) and some pretty fabulous statistics. More work to do fleshing out human questions that may be asked. Feel free to ask questions yourself, I will add them to my list.\n\nYou can now listen to kiwi calls, and a lot of noise at [Spotify](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/david-cary), I just gave up uploading more, there are about 20 something to be uploaded. The calls are selcted by a dodgy machine, not me. I tried noise reduction but it created distortion worse than the noise. It all has to be automatic, there were 2200 calls selected, can't do it by hand. WIP maybe.\n\nThere are 15 new moths on the way soon. Hopefully 8 will be on Rona, 8 on Pomona. They will record 1 minute in every hour of half hour and will require new batteries every 6 months to a year. The plan is to develop an automated way of assessing forest health. Eventually, it will take time.\n\nThe remaining 7 are free to go interesting places, the plan is to have as many as possible on Pomona during August for the Kiwi equivalent of the roar.\n\nNot many Kaka detected, they seem to be elsewhere.\n\nI will leave the stats at [skraak.kiwi](https://skraak.kiwi) to do the talking. I now have over 23000 individual calls in the database.\n\nSing Kiwi Sing

_Report:_ 
2022-12-29\n\nI finished the first pass over the data from my last trip on the 17th of December.\n\nPrior to the trip I had trained my own binaray classifier on 160gb of mostly Pomona data. About 10% was from Secretary Island, in total 4% of the audio was actual kiwi calls. It had very good validation statistics on the 20% data held out from training to check results after each epoch. Opensoundscape/pytorch made very good use of compute once I put the data on the ssd instead of the hard drive. It completed an epoch, including validation every hour, using 12 cores and big chunks of 100% GPU.  It trained for 95 epoch’s, but I lost the best  model due to a mistake I made, and ended up using the best model from around 75 epochs, there was very little difference in their statistics, decimal places. \n\nPredicting with the model was extremely impressive, it finished processing 800gb raw audio in hours, AviaNZ would have taken a week running 24/7. I ran it over all my data, close to 6TB in a few days, less time than I would have taken processing 1 trip worth of audio using AviaNZ. The results are unprocessed except for the new data fetched in December. Time is short.\n\nI over ran  my usage limits on Airtable which I was using for the first pass over detections. I found a very efficient workflow on my MacBook. I merge the spectrogram image and audio file into a video, all the details I need are in the file name, and I use tags in Finder to label files. The tag is written into the file metadata and I can later retrieve a long list of labels for each file. Working with Finder is extremely efficient, you can tag files with keyboard shortcuts, even tag multiple files at the same time, sort tags, etc. Finder is brilliant. The labels stick to the file because they are part of it.\n\nWhen predicting, Opensoundscapes looks at 5s chunks of audio with a 2.5s overlap. I get a long list of segmeents for each file, with a 0 or 1 assigned. There is some stuff going on there, to get a binary result and I may need to do some refining but overall it is very good. I then take that list, exclude any detection that falls in the day, defined by civil twilight. I made a thing that chunks it all up into actual calls, essentially I discard any detection that has no other detections nearby, but anything within 10s of any other detections gets chunked up. It works extremely well, no more half calls, except when they overflow a file during recording.\n\nI have simplified my labels, for kiwi, all I now label are Male/Female, and I mark Close calls so I can find them. I Plan to find duets algorithmically in future.\n\nI had a mind boggling 10 716 detections to wade through:\n- 11 files got a ?\n- 7 Geese\n- 22 Kaka, yes 22! C05, D03, F05, F09, H04, M04, S13T, T10.\n- 5 Kea, D03 & D09\n- 237 LTC (Long tail cuckoo, need to add them in to the model, its doing well though, mostly distant LTC detected.)\n- Many creaking trees from J11, also need to add them in to the model.\n- Loud close frogs are no longer a problem, but distant frogs now are! Also need to add them in to the model. The model pulls a lot of kiwi, even distant ones, from the din of frogs at N20\n- Only 22 morepork, my new model is right onto it.\n- A lot of dawn chorus, but also a *lot* of kiwi in the middle. Also need to add dawn chorus in to the model. Kiwi are active in the early mornings on Pomona, all the time.\n        \n- 219 Close Kiwi detections\n- 258 Duets, provisionally.\n        \n- 677 Female Kiwi\n- 2607 Male Kiwi\n- This is an under estimate, it is raw detections, many detections will be chopped up into more than 1 call.\n\nThis model detects a lot more calls than I am used to. Previously I had detected a total of around 5400 calls on Pomona. Must have been missing many many calls. I will find them.\n\nFirst I need to reduce my false positives.\n\nThe Plan:\n- Finish labelling this data\n- Construct a new dataset\n- Train a new model, this one will likely classify Male/Female/NotKiwi\n- Go through all my data with hopefully fewer false positives.\n- Train a new new model t use on the next tranche of fresh data.\n        \nI am aiming to label calls automatically in future, just weed out a few exceptions. Or that is wnat my goal is anyway.\n\nIn future my skraak notbook will need to be re-written to accomodate a simpler, more automated labelling scheme.\n\n## Video\n- [N20](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305180/Pomona/2022-12-29/N20-2022-12-17-20221013_050000-373-400_xdnlab.mp4)\n- [M04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305190/Pomona/2022-12-29/M04-2022-12-17-20221106_051500-283-310_puc3z6.mp4)\n- [M04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305188/Pomona/2022-12-29/M04-2022-12-17-20221106_051500-220-262_wnjzxc.mp4)\n- [M04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305187/Pomona/2022-12-29/M04-2022-12-17-20221106_051500-183-212_fllzsl.mp4)\n- [KS06](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305177/Pomona/2022-12-29/KS06-2022-12-17-20221021_053000-35-47_dixm57.mp4)\n- [K09](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305189/Pomona/2022-12-29/K09-2022-12-17-20221030_053000-660-712_mv0d68.mp4)\n- [J11](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305186/Pomona/2022-12-29/J11-2022-12-17-20221202_051500-728-750_rslqi0.mp4)\n- [J11](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305185/Pomona/2022-12-29/J11-2022-12-17-20221202_051500-633-655_k16rik.mp4)\n- [J11](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305186/Pomona/2022-12-29/J11-2022-12-17-20221120_214500-105-127_fijuas.mp4)\n- [J11](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305183/Pomona/2022-12-29/J11-2022-12-17-20221106_054500-723-735_tpbyyb.mp4)\n- [J11](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305183/Pomona/2022-12-29/J11-2022-12-17-20221106_054500-428-440_ijufpx.mp4)\n- [J11](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305189/Pomona/2022-12-29/J11-2022-12-17-20221106_054500-295-320_dvjfi0.mp4)\n- [H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305187/Pomona/2022-12-29/H04-2022-12-17-20221201_050000-420-530_qa0dpd.mp4)\n- [H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305181/Pomona/2022-12-29/H04-2022-12-17-20221128_051500-833-865_y5pzl6.mp4)\n- [H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305177/Pomona/2022-12-29/H04-2022-12-17-20221125_024500-518-555_utt58w.mp4)\n- [H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305181/Pomona/2022-12-29/H04-2022-12-17-20221116_044501-353-377_jketq0.mp4)\n- [H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305183/Pomona/2022-12-29/H04-2022-12-17-20221113_050000-208-265_r0dwno.mp4)\n- [F09](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672305182/Pomona/2022-12-29/F09-2022-12-17-20221127_051500-835-877_qemicg.mp4)\n\n\n## Audio\n- [H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672306552/Pomona/2022-12-29/H04-2022-12-17-20221128_050000-155-247_fzzrsl.wav)\n- [N20](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672306548/Pomona/2022-12-29/N20-2022-12-17-20221012_014500-153-190_ohqucq.wav)\n- [H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672306547/Pomona/2022-12-29/H04-2022-12-17-20221126_223000-338-390_jqspgv.wav)\n- [C05](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672306542/Pomona/2022-12-29/C05-20211127_021500_fijobn.wav)\n- [M04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672306541/Pomona/2022-12-29/M04-2022-12-17-20221112_031500-668-705_fidq4w.wav)\n- [N20](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672306541/Pomona/2022-12-29/N20-2022-12-17-20221012_023000-515-557_wn2lrd.wav)\n- [H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672306527/Pomona/2022-12-29/H04-2022-12-17-20221116_044501-353-377_s4dyxd.wav)\n- [C05](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672306526/Pomona/2022-12-29/C05-20211203_003001_fqls0f.wav)\n- [C05](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672306524/Pomona/2022-12-29/C05_20211029_020000_jmhlag.wav)\n- [C05](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672306522/Pomona/2022-12-29/C05-20211203_004500_ebnvs7.wav)\n- [C05](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672306522/Pomona/2022-12-29/C05-20211128_040000_eiai2y.wav)\n- [D03](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1672306521/Pomona/2022-12-29/D03-2022-12-17-20221018_010000-275-322_ldb59p.wav)

_Report:_ 
2022-12-06\n\nI finally finished labelling data from my  last trip 2  months ago, its been a marathon. Hoping to go to Pomona again next week to collect the latest data.\n\nNotebook at [skraak.kiwi](https://skraak.kiwi)\n\nH15, WB09, WD05  no detections.\nJ11  only one detection.\nI think this is possibly because the Kiwi are less mobile as they may have  been incubating eggs. Locations with lots of detections for this period may be  the home base of breeding pairs.\n\nNew active pair at KS06\nNew active pair at S13T\n\nF09 is very active and I now have almost as much data from them as I do from C05.\nThe pair at N20 make a lot of noise and so do the frogs, which  makes it a challenging location.\n\nD03 male seems to  have paired up  but not certain, need more data.\n\nKaka heard at M04 twice, and once at S13T. Please stay kaka.\n\nNext trip I am  going to do a big reorganisation, the core moths will remain but there are some new places that need exploring, gaps to fill in. \n\nLast week I attended an online audiomoth conference, and learned some stuff that can help me to move forward.\n\nI have discovered [opensoundscape.org](http://opensoundscape.org/en/latest/index.html). They have  written many bioacoustic primitives I can use.\n\nI learned that  the audiomoths save the temperature in the metadata of their files. I rewrote my code and  now my data includes temperature, battery voltage, time zone, moth ID. \n\nMy data now also makes it easier to write labels in a format compatible with Raven Pro, a commercial package from Cornell University. I need my labels in this format to be able to use opensoundscape.\n\nSoon I will take a look at how call behaviour relates to temperature. \n\nBattery voltage and moth ID can help to track down the cause  of noise, I will be able to exclude noisy data automatically to some extent, where required. Moths get noisy when the battery is flat, and some are noisier than others.\n\nTime zone info is just a good check to make sure my data is consistent.\n\nMy next steps:\n        Move the thousands of 15 minute files with kiwi calls, and their labels into one place.\n        Chop up those files into labelled 5 second wav files.\n        Train a binary classifier with more than 1 million 224px  square images, kiwi/noise. Lack of data is  not a problem. The problem is now too much data.\n        If it gets  it right more than 20% of the time that will be better  than AviaNZ, but 90% would be more useful.\n        Train a model to  take binary kiwi data and identify Male/Female/M&F, Close/Far so I dont  have to  do so much labelling, this last run I labelled  calls in 1700 files, probably 2500 calls. Many hours of work.\n\nSome  random audio:\n-  [Snapping shrimp](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1670288844/Pomona/Snapping_shrimp_8sec_uxvds1.wav)\n-  [Pond](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1670288844/Pomona/Pond_Example_vb389p.wav)\n-  [fish sounds](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1670288844/Pomona/Layered_fish_sounds_credit_Tim_Lamont_University_of_Exeter_wgh3ou.wav)\n-  [Snapping shrimp](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1670288844/Pomona/Snapping_shrimp_8sec_uxvds1.wav)\n-  [D09](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1670289076/Pomona/D09-20220926_040001_bvkvpo.wav)\n-  [M04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1670289078/Pomona/M04_20220914_200000_i9yks7.wav)\n-  [M04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1670289079/Pomona/M04_20220903_194500_e0pdui.wav)\n-  [C05](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1670289079/Pomona/C05-20220923_194501_amrpnw.wav)\n\nKill those rats.

2022-09-17\n\nWelcome to my Pomona kiwi newsletter.\n\nIf you don't want to know feel free to unsubscribe using the link somewhere at the bottom.\n\nAnyone can subscribe to this newsletter using this [link](https://tinyletter.com/fiordlandpacks).\n\nThe latest version of my notebook now has a permanent home at [https://skraak.kiwi](https://skraak.kiwi)\n\nI have finished labelling the 1550 actual calls detected over the winter. Avianz performed very well with a true positive rate of 41%, compared to its usual 20-25%. I think this is due to calmer weather with less wind and no Australian frogs confusing the issue.\n\nThe total number of calls recorded on Pomona is now 5739.\n\nThe first kiwi call detected was at C05, 21:04:32 on 28 October 2021, they are a busy lot.\n\nThe pair at C05 continue to call frequently.\n\nThe lone male at D03 seems to have found a mate, 2 female calls at the end of July including one duet. Maybe she is from D09, time will tell. He does a lot of calling anyway, it may be related to the busy pair at D09\n\nThere is a very active pair at D09 at the moment with a lot of duets and close calls recorded. Both of these recordings were made on the same night, they were close and the weather good so noise is no a problem. 30/07 between 1:15 and 2:15 am.\n\n- [D09](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663361849/Pomona/D09-20220730_011500_bxceo5.wav)\n- [D09](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663361849/Pomona/D09-20220730_020000_qibk37.wav)\n\nH04 remains very busy. Loud female call, followed by various duets, impossible to choose.\n- [H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663363986/Pomona/H04-20220621_190000_rozs8s.wav)\n- [H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663363998/Pomona/H04-20220707_224500_aus20b.wav)\n- [H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663363998/Pomona/H04-20220623_054500_tzncpn.wav)\n- [H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663363998/Pomona/H04-20220620_040000_wcwqfa.wav)\n- [H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663363998/Pomona/H04-20220623_203000_i3epde.wav)\n\nThere is now an active pair at J11 with lots of duets detected.\n- [J11](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663363177/Pomona/J11-20220627_194500_gi8hji.wav)\n- [J11](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663363167/Pomona/J11-20220729_061500_krqzq5.wav)\n\nQuite a few duets at M04, unusually large number of female calls here. This was a noisy recorder, it must have got damp, but seems to have substantially sorted itself out with time.\n- [M04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663363354/Pomona/M04-20220710_210000_rrjarh.wav)\n- [M04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663363360/Pomona/M04-20220710_023000_adf4ph.wav)\n- Another probably juvenile kiwi call heard at M04.\n\nNice N14 duet (very loud):\n- [N14](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663362751/Pomona/N14-20220707_001500_d6ep2a.wav)\n- Another busy pair discovered at S13T. The first recording very loud, the second very long.\n- [S13T](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663363592/Pomona/S13T-20220704_234500_rakibc.wav)\n- [S13T](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663363626/Pomona/S13T-20220628_021500_u1ndh7.wav)\n\nBusy couple at T10, are they the same as the N14 Kiwi pair? Both of these duets are on the same night, 23/06 between 7 and 8 pm.\n- [T10](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663362498/Pomona/T10-20220623_193000_ne26u5.wav)\n- [T10](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663362498/Pomona/T10-20220623_190000_wdqg8m.wav)\n\nCalls are mostly very distant at WB09, I may take this recorder away as it is a little out of the way and it is probably picking up the pair from H04.\n\nIs there an interaction between kiwi and morepork, there may be at D09 and T10.\n- [D09](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663362342/Pomona/D09-20220619_011500_wwiwae.wav)\n- [T10](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663362497/Pomona/T10-20220630_184500_oxpua3.wav)\n\nKaka, detected on the same flight at S13T and H04 on 19 June, 2 am.\n- [S13T](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663362102/Pomona/S13T-20220619_020000_gfzkgs.wav)\n- [H04](https://res.cloudinary.com/dofwwje6q/video/upload/v1663362038/Pomona/H04-20220619_020000_e268sh.wav)\n\nThe median number of calls per night at a site with a resident pair seems to settle at 4 calls, the exception is F09 but this may be because the recorder is elevated over a very large area, yet still sheltered from the worst weather. It is probably picking up calls from more than a single pair.\n\nNotebook at [skraak.kiwi](https://skraak.kiwi)\n\nI have some improvements planned for when I have time:\n- Graph median detections per day by location.\n- Graph median duets per day by location.\n- Graph male and female detections for individual sites over time\n- Graph duets for individual sites over time
