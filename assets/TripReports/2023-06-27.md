I was on Pomona and Rona around the 10th or 12th of June, after the bad May weather ended.

From 10 moth recorders 2766 kiwi calls were detected. 258 duets, 316 solo female calls, 1934 solo male calls. Best of all only 175 false positives, 7%.

I had to bring home the moths at F09 and G05 as they were giving an error code, having dried out they are ready to go out again soon.

5 new moths were placed on Pomona, recording 1 minute in 30, 24/7.

5 new moths were placed on Rona, also recording 1 minute in 30, 24/7.

In theory the batteries will last a year. I plan to refresh the sd cards in the summer to check it is all good.  The plan is to train a model to recognise more birds than just kiwi, they should provide a more accurate version of the 5 minute bird count, at least. Over a long period it should be a valuable and informative dataset.

The Hollyford Conservation Trust has agreed to let me place 5 new moths there, also  recording on the 1/30 schedule. Canâ€™t wait to get down there. I have my eye on the McKenzie Lagoon. (Ideal habitat for Haast Kiwi, perhaps one day, if the right people can agree. For them to grow and survive long term we need to get them the best habitats with well organised and motivated predator control.)

The skraak.kiwi website has not been updated, it is proving difficult to update and maintain. I need to make a better plan, perhaps as simple as a pdf report published to the website, thinking still.

The weather was pretty poor during the recording period, with a lot of noise and feint or distant sounding audio. Birds from the dawn chorus were not a problem. No Kaka found, some Kea from time to time.
